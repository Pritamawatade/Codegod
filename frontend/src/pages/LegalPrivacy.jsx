      <p className="mb-4">
        CodeGod ("I", "me", or "my") provides this Privacy Policy to inform you of the policies and procedures
        regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information received from users of my platform
        ("Site") and any services offered in connection with it (collectively, the "Services").
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Information Collection: Personally Identifiable Information</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        During use of the Services, I may collect personally identifiable information, such as your IP address and
        other persistent identifiers. This data is stored solely for providing support and ensuring smooth internal
        operations of CodeGod.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Cookies and Other Technologies</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        CodeGod uses cookies to enhance user experience. These may include session cookies that track interactions
        with the platform, route traffic, and analyze usage. You can disable cookies in your browser settings, but
        doing so may affect your ability to use some features.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        I do not share, sell, rent, or trade your personal information with any third parties unless required for
        legal compliance or essential operations. Some aggregated and anonymized information may be shared for
        analytics or improvement of the platform.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Service Providers</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Third-party tools or services may be used (e.g., for hosting, analytics, or infrastructure), but these
        providers will only access information necessary to perform tasks on behalf of CodeGod and are contractually
        obligated to protect your data.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Compliance with Laws</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Personal information may be disclosed to comply with legal obligations, respond to lawful requests, enforce
        policies, or protect the safety, rights, or property of CodeGod or others.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Business Transfers</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        In case of a future business transition (like a sale, merger, or acquisition), user data may be transferred
        as part of the assets, always under legal compliance.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Security</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        I take your privacy seriously and use reasonable measures to protect your information. However, no online
        transmission or storage is 100% secure, so I cannot guarantee absolute protection.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">International Transfers</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        If you're outside of the server’s hosting country, your information may be transferred and processed
        internationally. By using CodeGod, you consent to this transfer.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Links to Other Sites</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The platform may link to third-party sites. I'm not responsible for their privacy practices, and you should
        review their policies separately before providing any data.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Account Deletion</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        You can request deletion of your CodeGod account by contacting support. Once deleted, your account and
        related data will no longer be accessible. Some community contributions may remain anonymously displayed.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        I may update this Privacy Policy periodically. Any changes will be reflected with a new "last modified" date
        at the bottom of this page. Continued use of the platform after changes implies acceptance.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Contact Information</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
