      <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-center">Terms and Conditions</h1>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Welcome to CodeGod! These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") govern your use of the CodeGod platform (the "Service", "Website", "Platform"). By accessing or using this site, you agree to abide by these terms. If you don’t agree—well, then this isn't the code dojo for you.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">1. Who I Am</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        CodeGod is a solo-built platform (yep, it's just me). I’m working hard to make something epic that helps developers sharpen their problem-solving skills—without drowning in complexity or corporate fluff.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">2. Use of the Platform</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        CodeGod grants you a limited, non-exclusive, revocable license to use the platform for personal or educational use. Please don’t try to reverse-engineer, hack, exploit, or clone the platform (that’d be rude).
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">3. Account</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        You may need to create an account to access certain features. Keep your credentials safe. If your pet cat walks across the keyboard and submits a coding challenge, that’s on you.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">4. Refund Policy</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        I do support refunds—because fairness matters.
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
        <li>If you're unhappy with a paid feature, subscription, or upgrade, you can request a full refund within <strong>7 days</strong> of purchase.</li>
        <li>After 7 days, I may issue refunds on a case-by-case basis (for example, if something went horribly wrong with the system).</li>
        <li>Refunds can be requested via email at <a href="mailto:support@codegod.dev" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">support@codegod.dev</a>.</li>
        <li>Please include your email, transaction ID, and reason—no need to be formal, just be honest.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">5. Intellectual Property</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        All content, including problems, code challenges, UI/UX, and branding, is the intellectual property of CodeGod (a.k.a. me). You may not reuse or redistribute it without permission.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">6. User Content</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        If you contribute content (e.g., problems, solutions, comments), you grant me a non-exclusive license to display and use it within the platform. You still own your content—I’m just borrowing it to make the experience richer.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">7. Termination</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        I reserve the right to suspend or delete your account if you:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
        <li>Violate these terms</li>
        <li>Use the platform for illegal or harmful purposes</li>
        <li>Act like a jerk to other users (if/when I add community features)</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4">
        If that ever happens, you’ll be notified via email.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">8. Warranty Disclaimer</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        This platform is provided "as is". I strive for 100% uptime and zero bugs—but I’m human. I can’t promise everything will always work flawlessly. Use at your own risk and report issues when you see them.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        CodeGod will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages. If your coffee spills during a late-night code session, don’t blame the server.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">10. Changes to the Terms</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        I may update these terms occasionally. When I do, I’ll update the date below. Continuing to use the platform means you accept the new terms.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">11. Contact</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Questions? Suggestions? Want to collaborate or just say hi? Email me anytime at <a href="mailto:support@codegod.dev" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">support@codegod.dev</a>.
      </p>
